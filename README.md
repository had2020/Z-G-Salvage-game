# what is it
Z-G Salavge is a Godot 4 video game, the game is 2D and has a unique set of rules, it is a mix between a IO game and a space game.

--------------------------------------------

# how the game works
The player controls a orb on the screen with W, A, S, and D keys in order to move. When the player moves there ship moves in space, 
but with some drag. The player must use a basic understanding of how space works in order to dodge, floating spikes. The player has a portal 
it works as a shield, but as the player speed up it grows, this creates a problem, since the player is speed ripidly up in a low-friction space,
this makes it harder to dodge spikes in groups. When the player kills a spike by moving there shield, witch is controlled by moving the player's
cursor around, if hit an enemy with your growing shield the enemy dies and respawns, somewhere random around the map, but when you kill an enmey 
the player will grow making harder to dodge enemys, and this will need a bigger shield, meaning you have to speed up, making dodging even harder.
